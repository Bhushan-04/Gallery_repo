## 📦 Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone & Install**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd gallery_task
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root:
    ```env
    VITE_INSTANT_DB_APP_ID="your-instantdb-app-id"
    VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="your-unsplash-access-key"
    ```

3.  **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions

### 1. "Canvas-First" Design
To meet the "Premium UI" goal, I moved away from traditional sidebars. The UI "floats" above the content. The Feed is a "Pinned HUD" on desktop to satisfy the "Real-Time Visibility" requirement without cluttering the center stage.

### 2. InstantDB for Real-Time
Selected InstantDB over Firebase/Socket.io for its "Optimistic UI" and graph-based relational queries. This eliminates the need for complex optimistic update logic in Redux/React Query—the DB handle is the source of truth.

### 3. Conflict Handling Strategy
We use an **Append-Only** model for interactions. 
-   Instead of modifying a single "count" field (which causes race conditions), every emoji reaction is a *new entity* in the DB.
-   The client aggregates these entities (reducers) to calculate counts.
-   This makes "conflicts" impossible: if two users react simultaneously, two entities are created. Both appear instantly.

### 4. Masonry Layout
Standard CSS Grids leave gaps with vertical images. I used CSS Columns (`columns-3`) to create a true masonry effect that handles varying aspect ratios perfectly.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

*   **Tailwind v4 Upgrade**: The initial setup had missing PostCSS config. I manually configured the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin to unlock the latest v4 features.
*   **Real-Time Types**: InstantDB's schema inference can be loose. I implemented strict typing in the `store.ts` and component props to ensure type safety.
